            <li>Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.</li>
            <li>Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.</li>
            <li>Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java.<br> Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.</li>
            <li>Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.</li>
            <li>The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:<ul>
